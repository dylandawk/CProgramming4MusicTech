Big-O Time Complexity:
1. Linear Search: O(n) (slow)
2. Binary Search: O(log2n) (fast)
3. Hash Search: O(c) (fastest)

Tradeoffs:
Binary search requires the list to be sorted before hand
Hash search requires a hash map to be created before hand
both of these processes require a larger amount of computing initially, but lead to faster searches.
